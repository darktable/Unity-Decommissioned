    We
    must bring down the satellite. Use the satellite''s remote-controlled arms to
    ensure maximum damage from incoming obstacles.


    <b>You must use the correct
    tool to damage the satellite:</b> punch debris to jam the satellite''s arms,
    and shoot asteroids to break them into smaller pieces.


    Be discreet; the
