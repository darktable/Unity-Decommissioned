    The
    chutes above will constantly dispense fuel cells onto the conveyor belts running
    into our rover''s reactor. These cells are color coded: each one must go into
    the correct receptacle at the end of each belt.


    To complete your task,
    move each fuel cell onto the correct coneyor belt as they move toward the receptacles
    behind you. Fuel cells without active lights on them are defective: these will
    damage the rover if recieved by either receptacle, so be sure to discard them.


    WARNING:
    If a fuel cell is recieved by the wrong receptacle, it may damage the reactor!'
  m_alternateInstructions: 
  m_moleInstructions: '<color=#FFFFFF><u><b><size=200%>TASK: SABOTAGE ROVER</size></b></u></color>


    The
    chutes above will constantly dispense fuel cells onto the conveyor belts running
    into the rover''s reactor. The reactor must recieve the correctly colored fuel
    cells in the corresponding receptacle to prevent a meltdown: this presents an
    opportunity for sabotage.


    To sabotage the rover, move each fuel cell onto
    the coneyor belt of the opposing color as they move toward the receptacles behind
    you. Fuel cells without active lights on them are defective: these will damage
    the rover if recieved by either receptacle, so be sure to leave them on the belts
    when possible.


    Keep in mind that you may be observed by the crew as you
    work: be discreet.'
