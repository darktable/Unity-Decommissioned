    The
    pumps you see control the water pressure of the hose on the level above you:
    their color indicates which nutrient they will dispense into the water when used.
    Only your crewmate can see which nutrient each plant needs.


    The moisture
    of all plants must remain within the specified threshold at all times.


    To
    complete your task, observe the readings on the board: if moisture is too low,
    instruct your crewmate to water the correct plant on their side of the station
    to raise it to the appropriate levels. Be sure to verify the correct nutrient
    the plant needs with your crewmate before using the pumps.


    WARNING: Watering
    plants too little, excessively, or with the wrong nutrient may damage the station!'
  m_alternateInstructions: "<color=#FFFFFF><u><b><size=200%>TASK: TEND PLANTS</size></b></u></color>\n\nThe
    hose you see is used to water the plants beside you. The moisture of all plants
    must remain within the specified threshold at all times. In additon, each plant
    requires a specific nutrient that will change frequently, indicated by the colored
    lights attached to each one. \n\nTo complete your task, use the water hose next
    to you to water dehydrated plants as your crewmate specifies. Your crewmate must
    pump the nutrient of matching color into the hose's water supply for each plant,
    so be sure to communicate actively.\n\nWARNING: Watering plants too little, excessively,
    or with the wrong nutrient may damage the station!"

    pumps you see control the water pressure of the hose on the level above you:
    their color indicates which nutrient they will dispense into the water when used.
    These plants can only survive at specific moisture levels with specific nutrients;
    this makes them a prime target for sabotage.\n\nObserve the readings on the board: 
    instruct the crew to water the plants in such a way that the current moisture
    precentage remains outside of the specified threshold without arousing suspicion.
    The longer you keep the plants under or overwatered, the more damage you will
    do. \n\nBear in mind that you are being constantly observed at this station:
    discretion is paramount."

    Use the water hose next to you to water the plants
    the crew specifices with the wrong nutrients. Because the required nutrient changes
    frequently, this may require feeding innacruate information on the plant''s needs
    to the crew to ensure maximum losses.
