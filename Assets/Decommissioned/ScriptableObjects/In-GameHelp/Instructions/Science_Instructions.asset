    The
    chemical composition of the station''s life support is delicate and prime for
    sabotage. The monitor above you is displaying a recipe for a specific chemical
    needed to mantain it: the further from this recipe a mixture is, the more damage
    it will do. You can accomplish this by doing the following:


    1: Fill the
    beaker. To do this, move it to the dispenser and press and hold one of the colored
    buttons. Each notch on the beaker measures to approximately 1 milliliter (mL).


    2:
    Heat the beaker. Place the beaker on the burner and hold down the button to activate
    it. The screen on the burner indicates the beaker''s current temperature; note
    that hotter mixtures will do more damage than colder ones.


    3: Mix the chemicals.
    To do this, pick up the beaker and shake it. You may need to shake the beaker
    multiple times to ensure maximum damage.


    If you make a mistake, move the
    beaker into the machine labelled "CLEAN" on your right to clear out any chemicals
    inside of it and start over.


    Once you are finished, place the beaker inside
    the machine labeled "SUBMIT". '
