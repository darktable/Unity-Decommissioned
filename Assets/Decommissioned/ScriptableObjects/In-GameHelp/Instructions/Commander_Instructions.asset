    the Commander, you are responsible for manning the mainframe and monitoring your
    crew. From here, you can manually operate vital systems remotely and repair damage
    all across the colony. \n\nTo view a specific station on the monitor, press one
    of the labelled buttons to your left. Doing this selects the station:  once it
    is visible on the monitor, tap the keyboard to repair any damage it may have
    sustained through the night.\n\nKeep an eye out for any suspicious behavior at
    each station: your colony depends on it."

    As
    the Commander, you have access to the system''s mainframe, giving you direct
    control over many aspects of the colony''s vital systems. You can observe the
    crew as they work, as well as execute malicious software.


    To view a specific
    station on the monitor, press one of the labelled buttons to your left. Doing
    this selects the station:  once it is visible on the monitor, tap the keyboard
    to hack the station and cause damage.


    Exercise restraint when hacking the
    colony''s systems to avoid arousing suspicion.'
